    <p>My name is Akanni Ademola. I am from Nigeria. I am from Osun State but I was born and brought up in Lagos State. I like to making friends, playing game and make music. Throughout my primary and secondary school, I was popular for drawing. I have always dreamed of improving my visual intelligence, that is why I signed up for this class. I hope to make a good career out of this course.</p>
